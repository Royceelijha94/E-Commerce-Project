# E-Commerce-Project
E-commerce project refers to the programming languages and frameworks used to build and maintain online stores 
and other e-commerce websites. This type of project is responsible for the functionality and appearance of the website, 
including the ability to add and view products, create and manage user accounts, and process payments.

Common programming languages used in e-commerce web development include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
also includes Express, MongoDB, ejs and some other Popular e-commerce web development frameworks 
include Magento, Shopify, and WooCommerce. These frameworks provide a set of pre-built modules and 
functions that can be used to quickly develop and deploy an e-commerce website.

E-commerce web development code also needs to be compliant with the e-commerce code I described in the previous answer, 
like security, payment gateways and the handling of customer data.
